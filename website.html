            The game takes place in Liberty City, which is loosely based on some real life cities of the USA east coast, including New York City, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago and Pittsburgh, but it is not one of them in particular. There are different districts in Liberty City. It consists of three islands - Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale. The three islands are very similar to the real life islands of Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Staten Island.
        </p>

        <p class="mtext text-box" > 
            <span style="color: #FFA500;">Portland:</span> This is the initial area where players begin their journey. It includes locations like the Red Light District, St. Mark's, and Portland Harbor. Portland serves as the introductory district, introducing players to various criminal factions and activities.

        <p class="mtext text-box" >
            <span style="color: #FFA500;">Staunton Island:</span> As players progress in the game, they gain access to Staunton Island, which offers a more upscale and business-oriented environment. Key locations include Belleville Park, Newport, and the elevated train system connecting different parts of the island.
        </p>

        <p class="mtext text-box" > 
            <span style="color: #FFA500;">Shoreside Vale:</span> Unlocked later in the game, Shoreside Vale is the third and final district.
